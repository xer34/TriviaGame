Coding Bootcamp HW5 by Alexander Lewis

This game is themed around "Who Wants to be a Millionare", but with ridiculous questions in the place of normal ones. This game is useful to learn the principals of javascript objects and on-the-fly dom manipulation.

This project is not available for additional contribution from the github community, however Alex may be contacted through his website for help or questions regarding the project.
